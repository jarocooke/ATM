ATM design help

This file describs the way I want my ATM program to work.

A person starts the program.
The ATM loads the persons account details
The person enters their PIN
The ATM checks the PIN

If the PIN is correct options are displayed for Balance, Withdraw, Deposit and Quit

User selects Balance
ATM displays account balance
User selects Withdraw
ATM asks how much
User enters the amount to withdraw
ATM changes the account balance and displays the new amount
etc....

User selects quit
ATM writes the updates account details to the account file
ATM shutdown
